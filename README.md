# 🚀 C++ Evolution Lab

Welcome to my C++ development journey. This repository is a curated portfolio documenting my transition from foundational procedural logic to advanced Object-Oriented Architecture.

## 📌 Project Strategy
Every project in this lab undergoes a three-stage evolution:
* **v1 (Functional):** Core logic and procedural implementation.
* **v2 (OOP):** Refactoring into Classes, Encapsulation, and Design Patterns.
* **v3 (Optimized):** Enhancing security, performance, and memory management.

## 📂 Current Projects

### 1. UserLoginSystem (v1 - Functional)
A lightweight authentication system focusing on data validation and flow control.

* **Status:** `v1 Completed`
* **Key Features:** * User Registration and Secure Login logic.
    * File-based data persistence (simulated database).
    * Input validation to prevent system crashes.
* **Concepts Applied:** Header file organization, File I/O, procedural flow.
